# üåç Life Expectancy Prediction - Kaggle Competition

This project was developed as part of a **Kaggle competition**, aiming to predict the **life expectancy** of individuals in different countries based on a variety of health, economic, and demographic features. The dataset provides detailed insights into factors such as healthcare spending, immunization rates, and socioeconomic indicators, making this challenge a perfect opportunity to explore predictive modeling techniques.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies

The project is implemented in **Python**, utilizing the following tools:

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
  - `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` for visualizing patterns and distributions.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - `Scikit-learn` for regression model implementation and evaluation.
  - `XGBoost` and `LightGBM` for advanced boosting techniques to improve model performance.
- **Development Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for structured analysis and reproducibility.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure data consistency.
   - Engineered new features to capture complex relationships in the dataset.
2. **Model Development**:
   - Experimented with various regression models, including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and boosting methods.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance and prevent overfitting.
